## Components You Will Build

You will build a distributed secrets vault system. It includes running services and a small set of required definitions that make system behavior clear and usable by other systems.

---

## A. Running Components (Processes)

### 1. Secrets API Service

A long-running HTTP service that accepts requests for storing and retrieving secrets.

It will:

* Accept structured JSON input
* Authenticate requests and derive the caller’s identity
* Accept secret storage requests and submit proposed writes to the vault
* Accept secret retrieval requests for previously stored secrets
* Accept requests to retrieve the version history of a secret
* Accept `.env` file content and:
  * expand `secret(NAME)` references by retrieving authoritative secret values
  * process `enc(NAME)` references by storing the referenced value as a secret and returning `secret(NAME)`
* Enforce caller-scoped isolation on reads
* Fail deterministically if any referenced secret cannot be resolved
* Expose basic health and status endpoints

The API validates and forwards requests but does not determine secret existence or authoritative state.

---

### 2. Secrets Vault Service

A long-running service responsible for authoritative storage of secret state.

It will:

* Validate and persist proposed secret writes
* Persist multiple versions of a secret’s value
* Record validity intervals for each secret version
* Replicate secret state to peer vault instances
* Serve retrieval and history requests based on authoritative state
* Encrypt secret values at rest using envelope encryption
* Remain correct under partial failure
* Recover state on restart

All secret state is fully replicated across vault nodes. There is no key partitioning or rebalancing.

## B. Required Artifacts (Not Processes)

These are not separate running services. They are required artifacts that define what your running system means and how other systems interact with it.

### 3. Secret, History, and Isolation Model

A shared behavioral model implemented consistently across all components.

It defines:

* How callers are identified and scoped
* What it means for a secret to exist
* How secret updates are versioned
* How historical secret values are retained
* How validity intervals are assigned to secret versions
* What identifiers are used to reference secrets
* How isolation is enforced during retrieval and history access
* How retries and concurrent requests are handled
* What *not found* means under isolation

The model must be documented and observable in practice.

---

### 4. Encryption and Storage Record Definition

A required definition of how secrets are stored durably.

It defines:

* The stored record fields for each secret version, including ciphertext and encryption metadata
* Envelope encryption behavior:
  * A per-secret data key encrypts the secret value
  * The data key is wrapped by a configured master key
* The master key identifier stored with each record
* The behavior when the master key is unavailable or incorrect
* The rule that plaintext secret bytes are never written to durable storage

Key rotation and key lifecycle management are not included.

---

### 5. External API Contract

A small, explicit interface describing how clients interact with the system.

It will:

* Define request and response formats
* Specify error and *not found* behavior
* Describe durability, replication, and isolation guarantees
* Describe encrypted-at-rest behavior and failure behavior when referenced secrets cannot be resolved
* Describe secret history retrieval semantics, including version ordering and validity timestamps
* Describe `.env` encryption and expansion semantics, including secret creation behavior and all-or-nothing failure
* Hide internal replication and coordination mechanics

The contract exists to decouple system behavior from implementation details.
