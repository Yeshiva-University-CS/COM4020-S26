# Market-Maker Trading System

## Project Overview

In this project, you will design and implement a market-maker trading system that publishes deterministic bid/ask quotes for a fixed set of symbols inside a simulated exchange.

The market-making logic itself is intentionally simple. The core challenge of the project is distributed correctness: coordinating exclusive authority across nodes, recording shared state durably, handling concurrency, and recovering safely from failure and restart.

For each symbol, exactly one node is authorized at a time to cancel and replace the active quote. Authority is time-bounded, externally verifiable, and transfers automatically after failure or membership change. Nodes may join and leave the system, and symbol responsibility is redistributed across active nodes to balance load.

The system includes a simulated exchange that produces fills, authoritative state that records positions, and a control surface for enabling and disabling quoting. A simple graphical interface exposes live positions and recent activity to make system behavior observable.

You are not expected to implement real market connectivity, advanced trading strategies, or performance optimizations. The project focuses on correctness, coordination, and explainable behavior under failure.

## Resulting System Behavior

When the system is running correctly:

* Nodes register their presence and are considered active only while they renew it
* Symbol responsibility is computed from the current set of active nodes
* For each symbol, at most one node holds authority to issue quote updates
* Authority remains stable while the holder is healthy and renewing
* Authority transfers cleanly after node failure, restart, join, or leave
* The exchange simulator maintains a deterministic reference price per symbol
* The authorized node publishes one bid/ask quote per symbol
* Each new quote supersedes the previous quote
* Quotes are refreshed when observed state changes and at least once every 5 seconds
* External orders generated by the exchange may cross the quote and produce fills
* Fills update authoritative positions exactly once
* After a fill, the authorized node immediately replaces the quote
* Orders, fills, positions, and authority survive crashes and restarts
* A GUI displays live positions and recent activity accurately during failures and rebalancing

## Distributed Systems Challenges You Will Need to Address

You are expected to design, implement, and explain how your system handles:

* Exclusive, symbol-level authority across multiple nodes
* Time-bounded authority with safe renewal and expiration
* Deterministic redistribution of symbol responsibility on membership change
* Failure detection and authority transfer without overlap
* Durable recording of fills and derived positions
* Idempotent handling of retries and duplicate events
* Crash and restart during in-flight quote updates
* Recovery and convergence after partial failure
* Making authority, ownership, and state transitions observable and explainable

## Team Size and Time Expectations

This project is designed for **4 students**, working approximately **10 hours per week per student** over **14 weeks**.

Every milestone requires a **running, deployable artifact**; documentation must describe what actually runs.
